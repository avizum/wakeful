# Wakeful bot is no longer being developed. As you can see the original repo got deleted. The original owner of this repo is [jottew](https://github.com/jottew), not me.

wakeful is a discord bot with many different modules and over 150 commands, if the bot reaches the maximum amount of servers, where I'd have to verify it (which I won't do), then everyone that liked the bot and wants to still use it on their server, can run a new instance of this bot. If you have more questions, of what you're allowed to do with this code, you can look into the [license](https://github.com/jottew/wakeful/blob/main/LICENSE).
